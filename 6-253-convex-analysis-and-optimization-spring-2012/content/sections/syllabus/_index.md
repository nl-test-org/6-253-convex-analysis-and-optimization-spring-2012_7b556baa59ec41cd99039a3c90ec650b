Course Description
------------------

This course will focus on fundamental subjects in convexity, duality, and convex optimization algorithms. The aim is to develop the core analytical and algorithmic issues of continuous optimization, duality, and saddle point theory using a handful of unifying principles that can be easily visualized and readily understood.

The course places emphasis on proofs as well as geometric intuition. It is more sophisticated than [_6.251J Introduction to Mathematical Programming_](/courses/6-251j-introduction-to-mathematical-programming-fall-2009) and [_6.252J Nonlinear Programming_](/courses/15-084j-nonlinear-programming-spring-2004), and has some but not much overlap with these two courses.

Goals of this course:

*   To develop insight and deep understanding of a fundamental optimization topic
*   To treat with mathematical rigor an important branch of methodological research, and to provide an account of the state of the art in the field
*   To get an understanding of the merits, limitations, and characteristics of the rich set of available algorithms

Prerequisites
-------------

A course in linear algebra (preferably abstract) and a course in real analysis, such as [18.06](/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011) and [18.100](/courses/18-100c-real-analysis-fall-2012). Proofs will matter, but the rich geometry of the subject helps guide the mathematics.
